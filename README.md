Alex and Anthony's Super Fun Project Time
- We work on our own branches!
- If you want to collab with us, shoot me an email at agguzzy91@gmail.com

## Git Commands:

- To push your branch.
```
git push -u origin <branch>
```
- Removing an unwanted <b>item</b> from Repo you didn't include in .gitignore. This works recursively. 
```
git rm --cached -r <item>
```
